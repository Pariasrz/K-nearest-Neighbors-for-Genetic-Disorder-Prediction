# K-nearest-Neighbors-for-Genetic-Disorder-Prediction

The source of the dataset used in this repository is available on kaggle website and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aibuzz/predict-the-genetic-disorders-datasetof-genomes) I performed preprocessing and data cleaning on the dataset.

The code also includes K-nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch and sklearn library, then the algorithms are evaluated and compared using a method named "Average Error".
